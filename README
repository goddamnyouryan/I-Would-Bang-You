== I Would Bang You

I would bang you is a dating site I created in the beginning of 2011. The basic premise is: you sign up, upload some pictures, and browse through other members looking for people you are attracted to. If you find one, you click 'I Would Bang You'. They will be notified of this. If they click the same for you, you can message them.  You can also click 'I would date you' or 'eww gross no way'.  If the latter is clicked, you won't see them on the site again.

The code is a bit messy, especially the search, and the design could use a bit of work, but it is fully functional, and has about 4000 users, most of which are dudes.
